        <h1>Key Differences between writing in HTMl vs Google Docs</h1>

        <h2>Writing Aspect</h2>
        <p>In Google Docs you can highlight a heading and simply edit it, in HTML you have to write each item separately. For instance, you have to put h1 to get a level 1 heading. The primary distinction is that in HTML, you have to type everything out and then add extra code to adjust the font's color, enlarge it, adjust the text alignment, and other features.</p>
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>You must click share and provide the email address you wish to share to in order to collaborate on Google Docs. When it comes to HTML, you should take your completed code, submit it to github, share the repository with others, and allow them to pull and edit the code. The two main distinctions are that sharing an HTML document requires more steps and takes a lot longer than sharing a Google Doc. You cannot edit the code simultaneously.</p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>Google Docs is used to produce writing-related documents. With HTML, you can create websites with menus and links to other pages, just like you would with a traditional website.</p>
